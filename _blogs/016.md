love that stings like cactus, the view from the window, room temperature.
Left me absorbed and covered in the dark green moss, nauseous and hollow; the light leaking through the open wounds. cover me in silky smooth dark green leaves; don't worry about me; you wont find anyways. I'll disolve and will be absorbed by photosynthesis.
