<i class="pink">
We were not born simple //
In a million different ways //
something is off with us. //
I only read those signs through others

<!--
Maybe the life is not as heavy if you give up love. It becomes so light; lighter with every step; almost translucent: nehmotný and weight-less; a thin film that never disolves, almost like a plastic bag floating around; with so much option for movement. and freedom; but what are you gonna look for in that space? what will you walk towards, how will you navigate in that endless empty void? You can also just not exist.


I´ll offer all of me for someone else's self and body;
an exchange of two human forms, does not that sound fair?
Sign this Agreement, I promise Ill give all of me, feed on me, lick me and let me shelter you
-->

If you'd bear that sometimes things I say don't have a meaning; <!--don't make a sense; I am in pain--> I am in panic; sometimes I get caught completely hollow staring in the endless empty void that has grown through all our interactions, sometimes I catch a glimpse of it when you hold me: a tiny space that cannot be filled is like a rupture that all of a sudden reveals a canyon; a result of an angoing erosion; a grand canyon located in the living room; me: a confussed tourist, alienated by monstrosity of that natural phenomenon: getting dizzy, in small gaps of our dialogue; I know what you are about to say // don't think I am not paying attention;

I wish I could just love you mildly.
Did not have to hide from you the embarrassing affection I feel; I failed in being independent, self-contained and at keeping myself busy; climbing a mountain or meditation does not help; getting drunk with a random man, taking them home; doesnt help. just dissolves the sharp pain into many small dull object/thrusts perforing the skin; acupuncture of unrequested love; I don't wanna love you but I cannot help myself.

<!--
//Nenabodavala se na tvoje ostré hrany ostnatého dratu, kterymi si vyhrazujes osobní prostor;//
Exposed to the endless void; a world so empty and alien to me-->

I wish I did not have to hide from you how little I care about myself.
That I am just the shapeless mass that needs to varp around you like time around the heavy gravitation field; constantly <!--//odvracím neodvratnou kolizi//--> diverting an inevitable collision; waking up in the pravidelných intervalech just to keep the distance in the night; how come you are just so much better than anything else in my life.

<!--
You know all that is on my mind; and all that is on my mind is crave; I wanna be consumed and absorbed by you.
Maybe I am just an attention whore but I love you as noone else -->
