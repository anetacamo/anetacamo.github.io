how do I know that I will wake up next morning //
how do I know that this is the body of mine;
how do I know I am alive //

claustrophobic //
isolated // covered in skin //

a newly born - emerged consiousness // trapped in this construction of ongoing phisiological processes //

collecting the evidence: this is what we have:  
a background noise: a dreadfull soundtrack of this physiological machinery // a raising heartbeat // a clockwork orchestra of invisible organs; echoing in the empty void // on this ecrime scene //
