how do I know that I will wake up next morning;
how do I know that this is the body of mine;
how do I know I am alive;

claustrophobic //
isolated // covered in skin //

collecting the evidence: this is what we have:  
a background noise: a dreadfull soundtrack of the organic machinery // ongoing phisiological processes // speedning up: a raising heartbeat // a clockwork orchestra of invisible organs; echoing in the empty void // of this crime scene //

caught a face in the mirror // covered in sweat // burning. a foreign object // an intruder or a victim?
