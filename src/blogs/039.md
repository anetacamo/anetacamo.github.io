Maybe the life is not as heavy if yiuhlj
It becomes light; lighter with every step; almost translucent: thinning into a film, like a plastic bag floating around; so much option for movement but so awkward to touch, filtering the feelings untill you dont care to feel anymore; being safe; but what are you gonna look for in that space? what will you drift towards, how will you navigate in that endless empty void? You may as well just not exist, resign at the lack of oxygen and matter.
I´ll offer all of me for someone else's self and body;
an exchange of two human forms, does not that sound fair?
-->
<!--
If you'd bear that sometimes things I say don't have a meaning; I am in panic; caught myself for a moment: me, you and me - foreign to me- hypnotized by staring in the empty void that has grown through all our interactions, sometimes I catch a glimpse of it when you hold me: a tiny space that cannot be filled is like a rupture that all of a sudden reveals a canyon; a result of an ongoing erosion; a grand canyon located in the living room; me: a confussed tourist, alienated by monstrosity of that natural phenomenon: getting dizzy, in small gaps of our dialogue; gasping for air; death threathened; I know what you are about to say // don't think I am not paying attention;
<!--
I wish I could just love you mildly.
Did not have to hide from you the embarrassing affection I feel; I failed in being independent, self-contained and at keeping myself busy; climbing a mountain or meditation does not help; getting drunk with a random man, taking them home; doesnt help. just dissolves the sharp pain into many small dull object/thrusts perforing the skin; acupuncture of unrequested love; I don't wanna love you but I cannot help myself.

<!--
I wish I did not have to hide from you how little I care about myself.
That I am just the shapeless mass that needs to varp around you like time around the heavy gravitation field; constantly <!--//odvracím neodvratnou kolizi//-->
<!--
diverting an inevitable collision; waking up in the pravidelných intervalech just to keep the distance in the night; how come you are just so much better than anything else.
-->
<!--
You know all that is on my mind; and all that is on my mind is crave; I wanna be consumed and absorbed by you.
Maybe I am just an attention whore but I love you as noone else -->
