This is what we have: love that stings like cactuses, the view from the window, room temperature.

<!--
Left absorbed and covered in the dark green moss, nauseous and hollow; the light leaking through the open wounds  projecting the deep burried images onto the walls - glimpses of desolation. cover me in silky smooth dark green leaves and I'll disolve to be absorbed by photosynthesis into the bodies of surrounding vegetation, keeping an eye on you.
