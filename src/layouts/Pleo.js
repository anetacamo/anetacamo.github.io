            <p>
              I come from Prague and have lived in Aarhus for the past 6 years
              and can speak danish. I came here to study my masters in Aarhus
              that were combination of IT and sociology - and landed the first
              job at Praqma as student developer. Mostly with liquid, jekyll and
              wordpress at the time. <br /> Three years later I decided to go
              freelance as I discovered react. I was still in touch with the
              previous owners of the company and a graphic studio, and I
              received quite a few job opportunities through them. I built
              multiple web-apps and started using typescript and Next.
            </p>
            <p>
              Afterwards I got a job at an agency now based in Aarhus Ã˜ called
              Monstalab. I have learned a lot about writing code for larger
              scale applications and have worked extensively with Redux and
              backend implementations. I really enjoyed it, but this winter, the
              entire office was closed down, and since then, I have been working
              as a freelancer again.

              Currently I am working as a freelancer on an interactive map of
              Aarhus that is sourced from google sheets, using openmap. Built on
              react, typescript and next.

              I really enjoy frontend, love setting up new projects and seeing
              nice designs becoming interactive, I also enjoy trying out new
              frameworks or languages and would love to have an opportunity to
              work on some bigger projects again and solve problems that it
              brings.{' '}

              For the most of my time in Denmark I have been based in Aarhus but
              I am quite open to a change and can imagine myself moving to CPH.
              Working on some exciting projects in creative collective is the
              most important for me and I would not mind changing environment
              for it :)
