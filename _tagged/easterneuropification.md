description: Sidliste Pisnice - [maybe the only place in the world] where gentrification went reversed, no matter what traces were left in the bushes, what secret treasures were burried in those hills; with how much blood, sweat and tears we contaminated and marked this teritory; families made new families, kids went closer to the city. Last castaways still resisting the time slowly sinking in the sea of things collected over the years; but no regrets, its like the manifest of the life that has been lived - you cannot deny it; you cannot overlook it; all the proofs, relics, artifacts are here to be discovered in the layers of the time; the childhood, puberty, adulthood - open the archeological site; call the ministry of culture and start excavating. the child room still intact somewhere within there; dig the hole into the paralel universes; dig through the layers deep enough, Cambrian, Precambrian; a burried diary of angry years covered in the duct tape - dont touch it though when you find it; call the police.
