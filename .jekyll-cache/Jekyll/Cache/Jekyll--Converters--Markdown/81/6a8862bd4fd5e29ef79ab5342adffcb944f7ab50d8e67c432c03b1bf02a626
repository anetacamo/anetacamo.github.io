We were not born simple //
In a million different ways //
something is off with us. //
I only read those signs through others

Maybe the life is not as heavy if you give up love. It becomes so light; lighter with every step; almost translucent: nehmotnÃ½ and weight-less; a thin film that never disolves, almost like a plastic bag floating around; with so much option for movement. and freedom; but what are you gonna look for in that space? what will you walk towards, how will you navigate in that endless empty void? You can also just not exist.


IÂ´ll offer all of me for someone else's self and body;
an exchange of two human forms, does not that sound fair?
Sign this Agreement, I promise Ill give all of me, feed on me, lick me and let me shelter you
-->

<p>If youâ€™d bear that sometimes things I say donâ€™t have a meaning; <!--don't make a sense; I am in pain--> I am in panic; sometimes I get caught completely hollow staring in the endless empty void that has grown through all our interactions, sometimes I catch a glimpse of it when you hold me: a tiny space that cannot be filled is like a rupture that all of a sudden reveals a canyon; a result of an angoing erosion; a grand canyon located in the living room; me: a confussed tourist, alienated by monstrosity of that natural phenomenon: getting dizzy, in small gaps of our dialogue; I know what you are about to say // donâ€™t think I am not paying attention;</p>

<p>I wish I could just love you mildly.
Did not have to hide from you the embarrassing affection I feel; I failed in being independent, self-contained and at keeping myself busy; climbing a mountain or meditation does not help; getting drunk with a random man, taking them home; doesnt help. just dissolves the sharp pain into many small dull object/thrusts perforing the skin; acupuncture of unrequested love; I donâ€™t wanna love you but I cannot help myself.</p>

<!--
//Nenabodavala se na tvoje ostrÃ© hrany ostnatÃ©ho dratu, kterymi si vyhrazujes osobnÃ­ prostor;//
Exposed to the endless void; a world so empty and alien to me-->

<p>I wish I did not have to hide from you how little I care about myself.
That I am just the shapeless mass that needs to varp around you like time around the heavy gravitation field; constantly <!--//odvracÃ­m neodvratnou kolizi//--> diverting an inevitable collision; waking up in the pravidelnÃ½ch intervalech just to keep the distance in the night; how come you are just so much better than anything else in my life.</p>

<!--
You know all that is on my mind; and all that is on my mind is crave; I wanna be consumed and absorbed by you.
Maybe I am just an attention whore but I love you as noone else -->
