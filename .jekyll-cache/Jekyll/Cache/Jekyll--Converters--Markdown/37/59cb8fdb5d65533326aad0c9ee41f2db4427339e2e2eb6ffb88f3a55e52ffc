I"Œ<p>Let me talk to my window indoor plants on the phone now.
They know better about the Love that stings like cactuses.
Left me absorbed and covered in the darkgreen moss, nauseous; by open wounds prosakuje svetlo. My window room plant collection will soothe me now, cover me in silky smooth green leaves; dont worry about me; you wont find anyways, Ill disolve and will be by photosunthesis.</p>
