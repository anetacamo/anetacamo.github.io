but no regrets, its the manifest of the life that has been lived - you cannot deny it; you cannot overlook it; it's a monumental pile of life; if you just stand still for a while you might start disolving, too; a landmark of this flat; all the proofs, relics, artifacts are here to be discovered in the layers of the time; the childhood, puberty, adulthood - open the archeological site; call the ministry of culture and start excavating. the child room still intact somewhere within there; dig the hole into the parallel universes; dig through the layers deep enough, Cambrian, Precambrian; a burried diary of angry years covered in the duct tape - dont touch it though when you find it; call the police."-->

<p><br />Sidliste Pisnice - [maybe the only place in the world] where gentrification went reversed, no matter what traces were left in the bushes, what secret treasures were burried in those hills; with how much blood, sweat and tears we contaminated and marked this teritory; families made new families, kids went closer to the city.â€</p>

<p>meanwhile the bus from Kacerov still running on its orbit; as solid as a perpetuum mobile, devotedly feeding the wastelands of former meat processing plant with all kinds of leftover human forms; enter the lapidarium, sit still, become a part of this weird screenplay and let it consume you; wait for me Pisnice, Ill be there in 13 minutesÂ </p>
