how do I know that this is the body of mine;
how do I know I am alive //</p>

<p>claustrophobic //
isolated // covered in skin //</p>

<p>a newly born - emerged consiousness // trapped in this construction of ongoing phisiological processes //</p>

<p>collecting the evidence: this is what we have:<br />
a background noise: a dreadfull soundtrack of this organic machinery // a raising heartbeat // a clockwork orchestra of invisible organs; echoing in the empty void // on this ecrime scene //</p>
