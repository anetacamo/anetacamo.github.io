Left me absorbed and covered in the dark green moss, nauseous and hollow; the light leaking through the open wounds projects the moving images glimpses of desolation, it is like lying in the garden under the trees. cover me in silky smooth dark green leaves; don't worry about me; you wont find anyways. I'll disolve and will be absorbed by photosynthesis.
